Variants.
When connecting the TX line it will block the TX from the built in Wifi chip.
This will render the Lyfco app not working anymore. If you have a model with display it is not a big problem.
But if you have a mode without display the App is neccesary to set cutting shedule and settings.

Variant 1. No App support, easy to connect.
Variant 2. wit app support require a AND gate (4011 or similar) to be in series with the TX line.


Materials needed
- ESP8266 development board, like Wemos D1 or similar.
- For variant 2, a 4011 NAND gate.
- Thin cables
- Soldering equipment and skills.

Preparing the hardware
- Setup Arduino for your ESP board and compile the code
- Upload the code to the ESP using USB cable
- Run Serial debug window and typ CFG and Enter.
- Change config like Wifi, password, MQTT etc by typing like "CFG wifi_ssid=test"
- As soon it has connected to WiFi you can connect to its IP via web browser for more convenient settings management and monitoring.
- Solder 4 cables as shown in diagram, OBS If not using Wemos, Pins may be different.
- For variant 2, 5 cables in neccesary and the 4011 chip.


Installation
- Turn off the Lyfco completely and open the top cover.
- Locate the built Wifi module (White QR code sticker)
- Connect the 4 cables as shown in diagrams and pictures.
- For variant 5. Cut the PCB copper trace as showing in diagram and solder 5 cables.
